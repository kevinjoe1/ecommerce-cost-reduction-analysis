# ecommerce-cost-reduction-analysis
End-to-end e-commerce logistics cost analysis and 10% savings simulation in Python

This project analyzes shipping and operational patterns in a large Brazilian e-commerce dataset 
and builds a simulation model to estimate how much cost can be saved by optimizing high-cost orders.

### Key Highlights
- Cleaned and merged multiple Olist datasets (orders, items, payments, customers)
- Engineered shipping, revenue, and profit metrics
- Performed EDA on cost behavior, delays, and regional patterns
- Identified high-cost, low-value orders responsible for most cost leakage
- Built a simulation model achieving ~10% logistics cost savings
